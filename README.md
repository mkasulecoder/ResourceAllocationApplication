I'll demonstrate how to use dynamic programming for a resource allocation problem in operations research with a simple example in Java. Let's consider a problem where we have a budget and a set of projects, each with a cost and a benefit. The goal is to allocate the budget in a way that maximizes the total benefit.
Problem Description
•	Budget: The total amount of resources (money) available.
•	Projects: Each project has a cost and a benefit.
•	Objective: Maximize the total benefit without exceeding the budget.
Dynamic Programming Solution
We'll use a 2D DP array where dp[i][j] represents the maximum benefit achievable with a budget j considering the first i projects.
Steps:
1.	Initialize a DP table with dimensions (number_of_projects + 1) x (budget + 1).
2.	Iterate through each project and each possible budget.
3.	Use the recurrence relation:
      o	If we don't include the project, the benefit is the same as without this project: dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j].
      o	If we include the project, the benefit is the benefit of this project plus the best we can do with the remaining budget: dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[i-1][j - cost[i-1]] + benefit[i-1]).
      Explanation
1.	Initialization: We initialize a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] will store the maximum benefit achievable with a budget j considering the first i projects.
2.	Filling the DP Table: We iterate through each project and each possible budget. For each project and budget, we decide whether to include the project or not based on the maximum benefit.
3.	Result: The maximum benefit is found in dp[n][budget], where n is the number of projects.
4.	Traceback: To find which projects are included in the optimal solution, we trace back through the DP table.
      This example demonstrates the core concept of using dynamic programming to solve a resource allocation problem in operations research.
